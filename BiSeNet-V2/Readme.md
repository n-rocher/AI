# Road Image Segmentation

The purpose of this project is to create a real-time capable AI to detect a few categories of object on the road.
All images are segmented independantly.

# Categories

Those are the categories trained to be detected by the AI.

1. Road
2. Lane
3. Crosswalk
4. Curb
5. Sidewalk

7. Traffic Sign
8. Person
9. Bicyclist
10. Motorcyclist
11. Bicycle
12. Bus
13. Car
14. Motorcycle
15. Truck

# Datasets
The AI has been trained using a mix of those two datasets :
1. [A2D2 of Audi](https://www.a2d2.audi/a2d2/en.html) 
2. [Mapillary Vistas](https://www.mapillary.com/dataset/vistas)


# Tools
List of tools I used :
1. [Keras](https://keras.io/)
2. [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
